## Server-side Review. 

We're going get a refresher of some of the commands we need to setup a server-side API. In the process, we're going to be building a simple blog.

On [Day 1](./day1/readme.md) we're going to review setting up an express project, setup a few routes, and get our database setup with knex. We'll even through in some testing for good measure.

On [Day 2](./day2/readme.md) we're going to build a login form, get the login and logout routes working, and do some review of front-end form data.
